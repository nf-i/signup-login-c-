# signup-login-c-
A simple example of sign-up and login code using C++. This code uses basic file handling to save and retrieve user data.

Please be aware that this is a very basic example and should not be used for production-level applications without significant security enhancements.

This C++ code provides a simple command-line interface for users to sign up and log in. User data is stored in a text file (user_data.txt) in the same directory as the program.

For real-world applications, consider using dedicated authentication libraries or frameworks that provide secure user management.
